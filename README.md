# Introduction to neural networks with PyTorch (PyDay Bcn 2023)

Material for the workshop "Introduction to neural networks with PyTorch" at [PyDayBcn 2023](https://pybcn.org/events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2023/).

Description of the workshop:

> In this session, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of deep learning, explore the basics of PyTorch, and learn how to create and train simple neural networks. You won’t need a GPU to run the code from the workshop. All you’ll need is a computer with Python, PyTorch, and Jupyter installed.
